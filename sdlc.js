// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, where developers will take the input of requirements from stakeholders for what they want added to the software. Developers would then analysis the given requirements to determine how feasible the stakeholders' requirements are, and how to implement them to work with the main part of the software"

const design = "In the third step, after coming up with ideas from the planning and analysis the developers would put them together to form a high level design of the features, such as interfaces, models of how the data works within their features and how it would work with the established software. Essentially, giving themselves a rough idea of how they shall translate the requirements into code."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, where the developers would use the high level design from the Design step, to write out the code to create the software that will satisfy the requirements of the stakeholders while adhering to the established coding standards and best practices. There would normally be checks to make sure the code was functioning as intended and to check for bugs as much as possible before moving to the next step."

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, where the developers will take the completed code, and put through several tests that tries many different angles to see if it will still work properly under various circumstances. If they had made the software out of multiple parts, then they would test the parts individually for their respective functions to verify if they worked before connecting them together for further testing, but of the software as a whole. If the software passed all tests, then it will be integrated into the established software, or what system the developers were tasked with, to make the software for."

const maintain = "This is the last and repeating step for a long term use software, any developers tasked with this, will be monitoring the software to keep it up to date if it needs to be updated to keep up with the system it was implemented in, or to patch up errors or bugs that were discovered in the code by users, to keep a good user experience."
